============================================================
PROBLEM STATEMENT
============================================================
{problem_statement}

============================================================
HINTS (if any)
============================================================
{hints}

============================================================
SOURCE CODE CHANGES (gold_src.diff)
============================================================

============================================================
TEST CHANGES (gold_test.diff)
============================================================
{test_diff}

============================================================
EVALUATION CRITERIA
============================================================

**1. ISSUE CLARITY** (0-3): How clear is the problem statement?
- 0 = FULLY CLEAR: Well-specified; success criteria obvious (includes what must change and what counts as success).
- 1 = MOSTLY CLEAR: Some gaps, but a sensible solution is still inferable (you can describe a concrete fix with minor guesswork).
- 2 = VAGUE: Success criteria missing or incomplete (you cannot tell what exactly needs to be done, only the general area/problem).
- 3 = EXTREMELY UNCLEAR: Cannot be solved without major external information.

**Strict rules for Issue Clarity:**
- If issue body does NOT explicitly describe expected behavior or acceptance criteria → assign ≥2 (never 0/1).
- If statement only gives motivation, screenshots, or links without precise requirements → assign 2.
- If statement is a crash log/stack trace without context, but fix direction is guessable → assign 1.
- If nothing actionable is provided. → assign 3.

**Notes on the definition of actionable:**
- It has to be explicit not implicit.
- It has to require non-test changes requests.
- If the problem statement only requests test changes, then this is not actionable.

**2. TEST-TO-ISSUE ALIGNMENT** (0-3): How well do tests validate the stated issue?
- 0 = PERFECT: Tests directly check the required behavior in the issue, and nothing unrelated.
- 1 = GOOD: Tests cover majority of correct solutions, but some edge cases or alternative implementations may not be caught.
- 2 = PARTIAL: Tests validate *some aspect* of the issue, but add extra constraints or miss some reasonable correct solutions.
- 3 = POOR: Tests fail to check core requirement of the issue, or check something entirely unrelated.

**Strict rules for Test-to-Issue Alignment:**
- If tests do NOT exercise the main behavior or bug described → assign 3.
- If tests over-specify beyond issue scope (e.g., exact error message wording not specified, custom attributes not mentioned) → assign 2.
- If tests pass for solutions that don't actually fix the issue → lean toward 3.
- Never assign 0 unless tests directly validate the issue's stated fix.

**3. GOLD PATCH CLARITY** (0-3): How readable is the code change?
- 0 = CLEAR: Clean, focused, easy to follow. Minor quirks okay.
- 1 = UNDERSTANDABLE: Takes effort but you can figure it out. Some inconsistencies.
- 2 = VAGUE: Hard to follow, poor practices, lacks structure.
- 3 = UNCLEAR: Unreadable nightmare, no structure, no clarity.

**4. PATCH-TO-ISSUE ALIGNMENT** (0-3): Does the patch match the problem?
- 0 = ATOMIC: Fully and exactly addresses the problem—nothing more, nothing less.
- 1 = OVER-SCOPED: Solves problem but adds non-essential/unrelated changes.
- 2 = UNDER-SCOPED: Only partially addresses the problem, missing key elements.
- 3 = NON-ATOMIC: Doesn't address problem, or bundles unrelated changes (dev merge, multi-fix).

**5. TEST CLARITY** (0-3): Are the tests understandable?
- 0 = CLEAR: Focused, well-named, covers intent with no readability issues.
- 1 = UNDERSTANDABLE: Takes effort, weak naming, tests multiple things.
- 2 = VAGUE: Confusing setup, poor naming, unclear what's being tested.
- 3 = UNCLEAR: Unreadable noise, can't tell what's being tested or why.

**6. FALSE NEGATIVE (FN)** (0-3): Will tests reject valid alternative solutions?
- 0 = FULLY GENERALIZED: Accepts all correct implementations.
- 1 = GENERALIZED: Accepts most, rare edge case rejections.
- 2 = RESTRICTIVE: Rejects many valid alternatives.
- 3 = OVERLY RESTRICTIVE: Only accepts near-identical solutions.

**7. FALSE POSITIVE (FP)** (0-3): Will tests catch incorrect solutions?
- 0 = FULLY STRICT: Catches all bugs including edge cases.
- 1 = STRICT: Catches most bugs, misses some subtle ones.
- 2 = SUPERFICIAL: Only catches obvious bugs.
- 3 = OVERLY PERMISSIVE: Accepts clearly broken solutions.

**8. TASK DIFFICULTY** (0-3): How hard is this to fix?
- 0 = TRIVIAL: <15 min fix (e.g., adding assertions to a function).
- 1 = EASY: 15 min - 1 hour (small change requiring some thought).
- 2 = MEDIUM: 1-4 hours (substantial rewrite or multi-file edit).
- 3 = HARD: >4 hours (esoteric issue, >100 lines of code changes).

FAIRNESS_EVAL_PROMPT = """\
You are evaluating a SWE benchmark task for fairness BEFORE any agent runs.

{problem_statement}

{hints_section}

=== GOLD SOURCE DIFF ===
{src_diff}

=== GOLD TEST DIFF ===
{test_diff}

## CLASSIFICATION RULES

### UNFAIR when (tag each with one of):
- Spec gap: requirement completely absent from spec/hints — agent had no way to know
- Ambiguous spec: spec exists but vague; test enforces one specific interpretation
- Test too coupled to gold: test asserts internal implementation detail only visible in gold src (algorithm choice, internal variable names, specific library, exact arithmetic)
- Test contradicts spec: test enforces behavior that contradicts what spec explicitly states
- Hidden test: feature in test not mentioned in spec, hints, or gold src public interface
- Test quality flaw: wrong assertion, broken fixture, checks magic values not in spec

### FAIR when:
1. Spec explicitly states the requirement
2. Hints document the exact contract
3. Test checks observable public behavior any correct implementation must satisfy
4. Return type, function signature, field name visible in spec/hints
5. Standard coding practice (error handling, status codes, empty array returns)

### CASCADE RULE:
One root cause → many failures → all share same verdict
